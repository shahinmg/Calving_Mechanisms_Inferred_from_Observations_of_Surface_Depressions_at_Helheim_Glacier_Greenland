## Calving Mechanisms Inferred from Observations of Surface Depressions at Helheim Glacier Greenland

### Recreate Figures
Notebooks to recreate figures are in the `figure_notebooks` directory 

### Figure Data
Data used for the figures are in the `data` directory. If you are looking for the grounding zone and ground line data, please see the `data/ground_lines_and_grounding_zones` directory. The 2018 grounding lines are in the `2018_grounding_lines_merged_v2.gpkg` file and the 2019 grounding lines are in `2018_grounding_lines_merged_v2.gpkg`. 

### Analysis
Code used for some analysis are in the `analysis` directory. The fuctions for the force balance code are in `force_balance.py`. The script to run the force balance is `force_balance_stresses_its_live_arctic_dem.py`. Note this code was ran with ArcticDem and ITS_LIVE image-pair velocities. The force balance data file names are in `data/force_balance_data_table_S3.csv`.
